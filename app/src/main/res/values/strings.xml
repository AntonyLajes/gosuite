    <string name="lorem_ipsum">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</string>

    <string name="about_me">If you\'ve come this far, you\'re <b>probably interested</b> in the APP. If that\'s the case for you, <b>I deeply appreciate</b> and I am <b>honored</b> that you take some of your time to appreciate something I created.
        This APP is for <b>portfolio.</b> I am <b>currently looking for vacancies</b> in the Mobile Development Area using Kotlin. In this APP\'s Back-End I used some libraries like SharedPreferences and ViewBinding, indispensable for the <b>good organization of the code.</b> In the Front-End, UI tools such as NavigationComponents using Fragments, BottomNavigationView, RecyclerView and others (Source code available on GitHub). In addition to these tools, I constantly use libraries such as: <b>Firebase, Room, Coroutines and Retrofit.</b> In addition, other tools such as <b>AndroidStudio, PostGreSQL (in addition to SQL itself),</b> code versioning using <b>Git, GitHub and GitFlow,</b> and architectures such as <b>MVC and MVVM.</b>
I will leave my <b>contact links below.</b> Feel free to contact me either by email or on social media. Once again: <b>I thank you deeply for your time and interest.</b> Take care!</string>
