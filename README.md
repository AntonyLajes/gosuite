  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>gosuite is an Android app written in Kotlin to serve as a portfolio. This APP is based on basic fundamentals that a Mobile Developer must have. It is possible to observe the use of Libraries and Tools available for the creation of a dynamic, simple and objective Front-End, such as Navigation Fragments, Menus and Dynamic Buttons. In the Back-End there are components like NavigationComponents, ViewBinding and Classes. As this application does not have a complex Back-End, using APIs and HTTP requests, for example, I decided to keep the code and all the files well organized and simple, avoiding repetitive code.</p>
